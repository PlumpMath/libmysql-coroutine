  Simple API for spawning a co-routine, to be used for async libmysqlclient.

  Idea is that by implementing this interface using whatever facilities are
  available for given platform, we can use the same code for the generic
  libmysqlclient-async code.

  (This particular implementation uses Posix ucontext swapcontext().)
